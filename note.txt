*****************Commit = First Java Functional Program

  What we did?

    Printed list of no using Structured Programming approach and then using Functional programming approach


  In Functional programming 

         for each number we are calling print method, we are not calling print method directly
		b/z it will immediately  execute the code. We want to define behavior we get  a number as input.
		For defining, we use method reference.
		
		 What we are telling is?
		 Take the numbers, convert it into stream and for each element do a print
